# ByteCoin-iOS13

i cloned this project from: https://github.com/appbrewery/ByteCoin-iOS13

it only included the design and the skeleton of the files.

this is a bitcoin price-checker app. user can scroll through a picker view to select the currency they would like to see the exchange rate for.

this app implements the MVC pattern. this was a good learning process for me to understand protocols, extensions, and making a HTTP request. I was able to learn about decoding a JSON file in swift and the usefulness of protocols and delegates to listen to various UI elements or other methods within the application.

this was the first project where I was able to get data from an API and then disaply the data in the UI.
